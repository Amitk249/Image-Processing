# Image-Processing
# Image Processing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting objects, brands, and sports equipment in images using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The model identifies various elements within sports images, such as players, balls, jerseys, and branding logos.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Identifies players, sports equipment, and brands in images.
- **Brand Recognition**: Detects and labels sportswear brands visible in the images.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Draws labeled bounding boxes around detected objects.
- **Confidence Scores**: Provides confidence levels for each detected object.

## Example Outputs
Below are sample detections performed by the model:

### Example 1:

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and computer vision operations.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for object detection.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive UI to upload and analyze images.
- **YOLO/Faster R-CNN**: Object detection models used in the project.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/image-processing-project.git
   cd image-processing-project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Upload an image via the Streamlit UI.
2. The model processes the image and detects objects.
3. View the detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with more training data.
- Extend support for additional sports and brands.
- Implement real-time video processing.
